1. **What is AWS?**
   - Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a comprehensive and widely adopted cloud platform provided by Amazon. It offers a variety of cloud services, including computing power, storage, and databases, delivered on a pay-as-you-go basis.

2. **What are the key services provided by AWS?**
   - Some key services include:
     - **Compute:** Amazon EC2, AWS Lambda
     - **Storage:** Amazon S3, Amazon EBS
     - **Databases:** Amazon RDS, Amazon DynamoDB
     - **Networking:** Amazon VPC, Amazon Route 53
     - **Analytics:** Amazon Redshift, Amazon EMR
     - **Security and Identity:** AWS IAM, AWS KMS
     - **Developer Tools:** AWS CodeBuild, AWS CodeDeploy

3. **What is EC2 in AWS?**
   - Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) is a service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It allows you to launch and manage virtual servers, known as instances, with various configurations to suit different needs.

4. **What is an S3 bucket?**
   - An S3 bucket is a container in Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) where you can store objects (files). Each bucket has a globally unique name and can be used to store, retrieve, and manage data.

5. **Explain the difference between S3 and EBS.**
   - **S3 (Simple Storage Service):** Object storage service that stores and retrieves data over the internet. Ideal for large amounts of unstructured data like backups, media, and archives.
   - **EBS (Elastic Block Store):** Block storage service used as a virtual hard drive for EC2 instances. Ideal for storing data that needs to be accessed frequently and has a file system, such as operating system files, databases, and application data.

6. **What is IAM in AWS?**
   - AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) allows you to control access to AWS services and resources securely. You can create and manage AWS users and groups, and use permissions to allow or deny access to resources.

7. **How does AWS VPC work?**
   - Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) allows you to create a private network within the AWS cloud. You can define your own IP address range, create subnets, and configure route tables and network gateways. It provides isolation and control over your cloud resources.

8. **What are Security Groups and how do they work?**
   - Security Groups are virtual firewalls that control inbound and outbound traffic to AWS resources, such as EC2 instances. They operate at the instance level and are stateful, meaning if you allow an incoming request, the response is automatically allowed.

9. **What is an AWS region?**
   - An AWS region is a geographical area that contains multiple data centers known as Availability Zones. Regions are isolated from each other to provide high availability and disaster recovery.

10. **What are Availability Zones in AWS?**
    - Availability Zones (AZs) are distinct data centers within an AWS region. They are designed to be isolated from failures in other zones, providing high availability and fault tolerance.

11. **What is Auto Scaling?**
    - Auto Scaling automatically adjusts the number of EC2 instances in your application based on demand. It helps maintain performance and cost-effectiveness by scaling up or down as needed.

12. **What is Elastic Load Balancing?**
    - Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) distributes incoming traffic across multiple EC2 instances to ensure no single instance becomes overwhelmed. It improves fault tolerance and availability.

13. **What is Route 53?**
    - Amazon Route 53 is a scalable Domain Name System (DNS) web service that translates domain names into IP addresses. It also provides DNS routing and health checking for applications.

14. **Explain the difference between a public and private subnet.**
    - **Public Subnet:** A subnet that is connected to the internet through an Internet Gateway. Resources in a public subnet can be accessed from the internet.
    - **Private Subnet:** A subnet that does not have direct access to the internet. Resources in a private subnet typically access the internet via a NAT Gateway or NAT Instance.

15. **What is CloudFormation?**
    - AWS CloudFormation allows you to define and provision AWS infrastructure using code. You create templates in JSON or YAML that describe your resources and their configurations, enabling automated and repeatable deployments.

16. **What is AWS Lambda?**
    - AWS Lambda is a serverless computing service that lets you run code in response to events without provisioning or managing servers. You pay only for the compute time you consume.

17. **What is Amazon RDS?**
    - Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) is a managed service that makes it easier to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud. It supports several database engines, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and SQL Server.

18. **How do you monitor AWS resources?**
    - AWS resources can be monitored using:
      - **Amazon CloudWatch:** Provides monitoring and observability of AWS resources and applications.
      - **AWS CloudTrail:** Records API calls made on your account for auditing.
      - **AWS X-Ray:** Helps analyze and debug distributed applications.

19. **What is Amazon DynamoDB?**
    - Amazon DynamoDB is a managed NoSQL database service that provides fast and predictable performance with seamless scalability. It supports both document and key-value data models.

20. **What is AWS Elastic Beanstalk?**
    - AWS Elastic Beanstalk is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) that allows you to deploy and manage applications quickly without managing the underlying infrastructure. It supports multiple programming languages and frameworks.

21. **What is Amazon CloudFront?**
    - Amazon CloudFront is a Content Delivery Network (CDN) service that distributes content to end-users with low latency by caching content in multiple locations around the world.

22. **Explain Amazon SNS.**
    - Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) is a fully managed messaging service that allows you to send notifications to distributed systems and applications via various protocols like SMS, email, and HTTP.

23. **What is the difference between RDS and DynamoDB?**
    - **RDS:** Relational database service that uses structured query languages (SQL) and is suited for traditional relational data models.
    - **DynamoDB:** NoSQL database service that supports flexible data models and is designed for high performance and scalability with unstructured or semi-structured data.

24. **What are EIPs (Elastic IPs)?**
    - Elastic IPs (EIPs) are static, public IP addresses designed for dynamic cloud computing. They allow you to associate a fixed IP address with your EC2 instances, providing a stable endpoint for applications.

25. **How does AWS CloudTrail work?**
    - AWS CloudTrail records API calls made on your account and delivers log files to an S3 bucket. It helps with auditing, compliance, and security monitoring by tracking activities and changes.

26. **What is Amazon CloudWatch?**
    - Amazon CloudWatch provides monitoring for AWS cloud resources and applications. It collects and tracks metrics, collects and monitors log files, and sets alarms to respond to changes in your AWS resources.

27. **What is the AWS Free Tier?**
    - The AWS Free Tier provides a limited quantity of AWS services for free, allowing users to explore and try AWS services without incurring costs. It includes a combination of 12-month free services, always free services, and trial offers.

28. **What is a NAT Gateway?**
    - A NAT (Network Address Translation) Gateway allows instances in a private subnet to access the internet while remaining unreachable from the internet. It provides outbound internet access for resources in a private subnet.

29. **Explain the Shared Responsibility Model in AWS.**
    - The Shared Responsibility Model is a security and compliance framework where AWS manages the security of the cloud infrastructure, and customers manage the security in the cloud, including data protection, identity management, and application security.

30. **What are AWS Tags and why are they used?**
    - AWS Tags are metadata attached to AWS resources in the form of key-value pairs. They are used for resource management, cost tracking, automation, and access control, helping organize and manage resources more effectively.
